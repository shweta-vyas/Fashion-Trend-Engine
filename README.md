## About The Project

The Fashion Trend Forecasting Engine is an interactive dashboard designed to analyze and forecast emerging fashion trends using real-time data from Google Trends.

The primary goal of this application is to provide an intuitive tool for exploring the lifecycle of various fashion items, aesthetics, brands, and colors. By visualizing search interest over time, the dashboard helps identify a trend's current popularity, its regional hotspots, and its potential future trajectory.

**Current Status:** This is a fully functional prototype built with Python and Streamlit. The core analysis and forecasting modules are complete and powered by the Google Trends API.
