Project Summary: Fashion-Trend-Engine

The "Trend Intelligence Engine" is a comprehensive data analytics project
designed to discover, analyze, and forecast emerging fashion trends.
The core technical approach involves creating a multi-source data pipeline that automatically collects and combines trend information 
from three key cultural platforms: Pinterest, Reddit, and Google Trends.

The project is being developed in phases.
The current version is a fully functional prototype dashboard built with Python and Streamlit,
which uses the Google Trends API as its initial data source. 
This prototype can already analyze a trend's lifecycle, forecast its short-term potential, and identify its regional popularity.

The ultimate outcome of the project is to create
a complete, multi-source intelligence tool. 
Once access to the Pinterest API is granted, 
its data will be integrated with the existing Google Trends and Reddit data fetchers to provide a holistic and 
highly accurate view of the fashion landscape. The entire system is designed to be automated, with a 
centralized database and A dashboard for analysis.
